# Kickstarter-analysis with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
---
## Overview of Project
A playwright, Louise, is funding her play "Fever" via a crowdfunding campaign. Her play got close to her fundrasing goal and would now like some insight into how other campaigns fared based on two factors: the campaign launch date and the campaign goals.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise find out how different campaigns faired with respect to when they launched and what their funding goals were.

## Analysis and Challenges
The file and any subsequent analysis can be found in the file below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To better visualize the outcomes of crowdfunded campaigns with respect to when the campaigns launched I first extracted the year of launch from the "Date Created Conversion" column using the YEAR() function. This column had been previosuly generated by converting the unix timestamp to a date in the (yyyy-mm-dd) format. 
The Image below shows the function used and the column created.

Next a pivot table using the Kickstarter worksheet was created. This pivot table was generated in a new worksheet called "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date". The Outcomes field was displayed in both the columns area and the values are to get the Count of outcomes. Next the Parent Category and the Years column were used in the filters area. Finally, the Date Created Conversion column was used in the rows area; this field when placed here gets plit into three different fields: Date Created Conversion, Years, and Quarters - the only field that is kept is the Date Created Conversion field. The Outcome column labels are then filtered to only show the cancelled, failed, and successful outcomes. The pivot table at this stage can be viewed in the image below.

Following this I focused on theater campaigns by filtering the Parent Category to only show theater campaigns and resorted the outcome data in descending order to show the successful campaigns first. This can be viewed in the image of the pivot table below.

Finally to visualize this data I created a line chart from the pivot table. This line chart is better able to show us the relationship between outcome and launch months.





### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
